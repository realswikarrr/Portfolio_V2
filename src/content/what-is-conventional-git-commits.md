## Conventional Git Commits

Few months back I got introduced to the `conventional commits` and it just changed my way of git commits.

## Conventional Commits Example

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

> feat /
> fix /
> docs /
> style /
> refactor /
> perf /
> test /
> build /  
> ci /
> chore /
> revert

All of this have different use case scenarios for example feat is used when there is new feature added to the app and fix is used when you
fix the bug.
